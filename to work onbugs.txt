Game breaking bugs:
Jet on the 3rd day stops you from leaving the cave, freezing the game
If genko hasn't moved forward one after the fight, you are stuck
you can still go back to the farm in the final scene, ruining the ending

general bugs:
mother and chiori just walk into the wall and don't go back
dwarf seizure at tavern

serious concerns by users:
writing feels a bit forced, needed overhaul
fishing is boring
overall crafting system needs serious work
fighting is too difficult
maybe have someone warning the player not to go straight into the forest without training/equipping armor
the text boxes don't flow well, completely redo with new text.
not enough interaction between character and townspeople
tavern is empy every day except for last.
hard to talk to everyone at the final day due to map being small
small mispellings
apprenticing doesn't open up too much gameplay (add a lot more to crafting, cooking, fighting, fishing mini game)
ideas for future:
wait until I've learned a lot more, serious work needs to be put in the make the game playable the way I want it to be.
